          <!-- Intro -->
          <h2>Hello! I'm Sam.</h2>
          <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA. Previously, I have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>worked as an <b>educator</b> of middle school students, high school students, college students, and adults, in the United States and China</li>
            <li>done <b>hands-on biology research</b>, designing and executing molecular biology experiments investigating the HIV immune response, stem cell development, lung cancer tumorigenesis, and DNA structure</li>
            <li>used a <b>broad range of technical tools</b> - including Python, R, and Bash - to analyze extremely large bioinformatics data sets, create publication-quality data figures, and communicate scientific results in journal articles and conferences presentations </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Through this diverse set of professional experiences, I have develped great skills in problem-solving, troubleshooting, team collaboration, and communicating complex topics. I will apply all of these skills, along with a rapidly-developing programming ability, to any technical challenges I face as a software developer, making me an invaluable member of your team.</p>

          <!-- About me -->
          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I earned my PhD in molecular and cellular biology from the University of Washington, in <a href="https://research.fhcrc.org/tsukiyama/en.html">a lab located at Seattle's Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center</a>. While conducting my PhD research, I used a lot of Python, Bash, and R, and found that I loved programming.
          
          In particular, I found it immensely gratifying to use R to create beautiful, publication-quality figures that looked just how I wanted; or to write Python scripts that could efficiently analyze huge, genome-wide data sets; or to create Bash scripts that could transform three hours of painstaking, repetitive typing at the command-line into a simple process of "run one script, go have lunch, and come back to folders full of neatly analyzed data"! Based largely on that experience, I am now extremely excited to be pursuing a career in software development.</p>
          
          <p>Outside of my passions for programming, science, and teaching, I love to spend as much time as possible in the outdoors, in particular:</p>
